# LinuxMalRed
Self-learn project about malware development for Redteam Operation on Linux

Personal hobby. It's going to use Python (might be Nim) to learn from scratch basic concept of Malware development, to (hopefully) more advanced skills. The point is to learn the mindset and concept rather than actual malicious activity, so Python might be a good choice.
